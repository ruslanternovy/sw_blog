Hello my guest!

It's 2019! I am starting a new year by writing my first blog post using a new tool for blogs called Jekyll. Previously I had blogs based on different platforms including Blogspot, Facebook, Mail.ru. Those platforms worked fine, but sometimes I wasn't happy about something with them.

The idea to start a new blog appeared at the end of 2018. I decided to find a blogging tool that would be just enough for my needs. In particular, code highlighting functionality and simple text editing.

Jekyll attracted my attention. It's a tool for generating static websites. You locally have to create content and move it to a hosting. Many software developers use this tool to create their blogs. They use GitHub platform to host their blogs.

I decided to give it a try and see how it works. It took me a couple of hours to read an introduction and how to start using the tool. After that, I wrote and published this first blog post.
