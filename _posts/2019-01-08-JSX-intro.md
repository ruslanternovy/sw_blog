Interaction between JSX and JavaScript

In the middle of our javascript there can be something like html which is essentially JSX.

function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  )
}

The whole line *<h1>Hello world!</h1>* is actually a JSX syntax.

For example if we declare two variables in the given function:

function App() {
  const greeting = “Hello”
  const addressee = “world”  
  return (
    <h1>{greeting + " " + addressee}!</h1>
  )
}

The whole line *<h1>{greeting + " " + addressee}!</h1>* is a JSX syntax. One thing to note: once the line starts with a “less sign” everything is treated as if this is an html text until an opening curly brace. The closing curly brace means that we are leaving javascript and switching to html. That continues until a “more sign” (a closing angle bracket of the last html tag in this line) occurs.

The ES6 string templating syntax will look like this:

<h1>Hello {`${greeting} ${addressee}`}!</h1>

Another example of combination JSX and html: when it’s a morning, say “Good morning!” and when it’s night - “Good night!”.

function App() {
  const date = new Date()

  return (
    <h1>It is currently about {date.getHours() % 12} o'clock!</h1>
  )
}

function App() {
  const date = new Date()
  const hours = date.getHours()
  let timeOfDay

  if (hours < 12) {
    timeOfDay = "morning"
  } else if (hours >= 12 && hours < 17) {
    timeOfDay = "afternoon"
  } else {
    timeOfDay = "night"
  }

  return (
    <h1>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>
  )
}

One thing to note: in JSX html is not exactly html. For example a line of code from a previous function:

<h1 style="color: #FF8C00">Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>

will give us an error:

*Invariant Violation: The `style` prop expects a mapping from style properties to values, not a string. For example, style={{marginRight: spacing + 'em'}} when using JSX. (/node_modules/fbjs/lib/invariant.js:42)*

In this case JSX expects style to not be a string, but instead to be an object - a JS object.

<h1 style={{color: "#FF8C00"}}>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>

Note the double curly braces. Anytime you want to change from JSX into JS you need to wrap a javascript with a set of curly braces.

Another thing about JSX is that it’s

<h1 style={{color: "#FF8C00" background-color: "#FF2D00”}}>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>

The line above is not going to work since *background-color* doesn’t have a proper JS syntax. To fix this problem we need to change *background-color* to *backgroundColor* - to get rid of the dash and to follow the general JS naming camel style.

<h1 style={{color: "#FF8C00" backgroundColor: "#FF2D00”}}>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>

The line still looks complicated but we can always retrieve the object from it and create a separate object variable:

const style = {
  color: "#FF8C00”,
  backgroundColor: "#FF2D00”
}

<h1 style={style}>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>
