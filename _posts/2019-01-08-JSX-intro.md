This post is based on a course Learn React for free. In particular [video1](https://scrimba.com/p/p7P5Hd/c6G36SV) and [video2](https://scrimba.com/p/p7P5Hd/cbyv9hb).

Interaction between JSX and JavaScript
In the middle of our javascript there can be something like html which is essentially JSX.
{% highlight JSX %}
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  )
}
{% endhighlight %}
The whole line *<h1>Hello world!</h1>* is actually a JSX syntax.
For example if we declare two variables in the given function:
{% highlight JSX %}
function App() {
  const greeting = "Hello"
  const addressee = "world"
  return (
    <h1>{greeting + " " + addressee}!</h1>
  )
}
{% endhighlight %}
The whole line *<h1>{greeting + " " + addressee}!</h1>* is a JSX syntax. One thing to note: once the line starts with a “less sign” everything is treated as if this is an html text until an opening curly brace. The closing curly brace means that we are leaving javascript and switching to html. That continues until a “more sign” (a closing angle bracket of the last html tag in this line) occurs.

The ES6 string templating syntax will look like this:
{% highlight HTML %}
<h1>Hello {`${greeting} ${addressee}`}!</h1>
{% endhighlight %}
Another example of combination JSX and html: when it’s a morning, say “Good morning!” and when it’s night - “Good night!”.
{% highlight JSX %}
function App() {
  const date = new Date()

  return (
    <h1>It is currently about {date.getHours() % 12} o'clock!</h1>
  )
}

function App() {
  const date = new Date()
  const hours = date.getHours()
  let timeOfDay

  if (hours < 12) {
    timeOfDay = "morning"
  } else if (hours >= 12 && hours < 17) {
    timeOfDay = "afternoon"
  } else {
    timeOfDay = "night"
  }

  return (
    <h1>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>
  )
}
{% endhighlight %}
One thing to note: in JSX html is not exactly html. For example a line of code from a previous function:
{% highlight HTML %}
<h1 style="color: #FF8C00">Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>
{% endhighlight %}
will give us an error:
*Invariant Violation: The `style` prop expects a mapping from style properties to values, not a string. For example, style={% raw %}{{marginRight: spacing + 'em'}}{% endraw %} when using JSX. (/node_modules/fbjs/lib/invariant.js:42)*
In this case JSX expects style to not be a string, but instead to be an object - a JS object.
{% highlight HTML %}
{% raw %}<h1 style={{color: "#FF8C00"}}>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
Note the double curly braces. Anytime you want to change from JSX into JS you need to wrap a javascript with a set of curly braces.
Another thing about JSX is that it’s
{% highlight HTML %}
{% raw %}<h1 style={{color: "#FF8C00" background-color: "#FF2D00”}}>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
The line above is not going to work since *background-color* doesn’t have a proper JS syntax. To fix this problem we need to change *background-color* to *backgroundColor* - to get rid of the dash and to follow the general JS naming camel style.
{% highlight HTML %}
{% raw %}<h1 style={{color: "#FF8C00" backgroundColor: "#FF2D00”}}>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>{% endraw %}
The line still looks complicated but we can always retrieve the object from it and create a separate object variable:
const style = {
  color: "#FF8C00”,
  backgroundColor: "#FF2D00”
}
<h1 style={style}>Good {timeOfDay}!</h1>
{% endhighlight %}
