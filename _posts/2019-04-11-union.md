This note is going to be about unions in C++. A union is a user-defined type that uses same block of memory for every its list member. This definition was given [in this source](http://www.anyexample.com/programming/cplusplus/example_of_using_union_in_cplusplus.xml). The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union.

{% highlight cpp %}
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;
int main() {
   union abc {
		int x;
		char ch;
	} var;

   var.x = 65;
   cout << var.ch;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The output of the program would be "A".

I intentionally brought this type of a test since in the test that I was taking the task was a bit different:

{% highlight cpp %}
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;
int main() {
   union abc {
		int x;
		char ch;
	} var;

   var.ch = 'A';
   cout << var.x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you see the value of the union member ch is A whereas the value x according to the test from [tutorial's point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com) is 65, as according to the explanation from the site: "the union variables share common memory for all its elements, x gets ‘A’ whose ASCII value is 65 and is printed". Not really, my version of the c++ compiler which is to the moment is clang-1001.0.46.3 shows that the value in the union abc was initialized to some garbage value (32822), after assignment to the member ch a value 'A', value x became (32833) which is not what test result says to us.

Let's dig deeper. I found [one interesting question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7751242/does-a-union-always-have-default-value-of-zero) where a very similar situation is discussed. The best answer quotes the c++ standard which says:
If an object that has static or thread storage duration is not initialized explicitly, then:

- if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer;
- if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero;
- if it is an aggregate, every member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules, and any padding is initialized to zero bits;
- if it is a union, the first named member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules, and any padding is initialized to zero bits

It means that technically the value x should be initialized with 0. By now everything is against my clang version. Further down the responders states: _the union in this first has static storage duration and in the second the union has automatic storage duration. This results in completely different semantics for uninitialized variables._ That's the gist of the issue. Let's try to put our union in the static section where global variables are defined:

{% highlight cpp %}
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

union abc {
 int x;
 char ch;
} var;

int main() {
   var.ch = 'A';
   cout << var.x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Right now everything is correct and the value of x is going to be 65. I will try to send a letter to tutorial's point to point out on the mistake that they have in their test.
