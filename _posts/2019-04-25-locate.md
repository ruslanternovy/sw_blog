I have been using locale utility on and off through all my career. It's a very useful tool when it comes to find a file efficiently quickly. By default only a couple of Linux distributives provide this utility by default. Other Linux distributives allow to install and use it. To start using this utility you have to simply install it using the next command:
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install mlocate
{% endhighlight%}
On my mac computer I had this utility preinstalled. To start using it just update the utility database using the command:
{% highlight bash %}
sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb
{% endhighlight%}
Now the reason for writing this post was that I have removed a software from my computer but after using locate, some the remains from the program still left in the database of the locate utility. I could have executed the command above, but found a better way for that by creating a symlink for the command:
{% highlight bash %}
cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb updatedb
{% endhighlight%}
After executing previous commands all you need is just to restart your terminal and to use the command for updating the database.
