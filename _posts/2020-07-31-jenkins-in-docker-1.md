This is a first post from the series about how to run Jenkins in a Docker container.
The end goal is to spin up a docker container with Jenkins building a Golang code.

This post is dedicated setting up Jenkins that is run in a docker container.

First step I took is a docker installation. Docker software was installed fairly easy.
I was following the instructions from the [docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
